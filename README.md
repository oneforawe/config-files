# Configuration Files

This repository contains my personal user configuration files.  The purpose of
this repo is mostly for my own convenience when setting up my own working
environments on new machines.  But for anyone who's curious, it's also here for
you to peruse or try out and to share ideas.

## Installation

Clone the repo to copy the files:  
   `git clone https://github.com/oneforawe/config-files.git ~/.config-files`

Run this command to over-write existing configuration files with links to the
config files in this repo:  
   `bash ~/.config-files/setup/link-config-files.sh`

## Terminology

Configuration files are often hidden files, by default not shown when viewing
the contents of directories so as to not clutter up one's view or confuse
regular users who are unaware of their purpose.  In Unix-like operating systems,
any file or folder starting with a period (a "dot") is treated as a hidden file
or hidden folder.

Configuration files are also called config-files, dot-files, initialization
files, init-files, run-commands files, rc-files, and so on.
