More Detailed Notes
===================

Linux Updates
-------------
[1] apt update  &&  apt upgrade
    (for all package-managed apps in Linux)
[2] apt-get clean
    (removes package files)
[3] apt-get autoremove
    (apt-get --dry-run autoremove)
    (removes packages that are no longer needed
     by packages that were directly installed by package manager --
     beware of removing packages that you may have installed without the
     package manager or that you've become accustomed to using even though
     you didn't *directly* install with the manager)


VirtualBox Virtual Machine -- running headless
----------------------------------------------
VBoxManage startvm "VM name" --type headless
vboxmanage startvm "Kubuntu" --type headless

vboxmanage list vms
vboxmanage list runningvms

VBoxManage controlvm <vm> acpipowerbutton

(Alternatively, when desperate: VBoxManage controlvm "Kubuntu" poweroff)



Logging-in to Virtual Machine
-----------------------------
ssh -p 5022 zero@localhost



Entering my Action Management System
------------------------------------
tree ~/org | grep \#
cd ~/org
emacs Projects/*.org Trigger/*.org Review/More/*.org Review/*.org

 - softwareupdate -l; softwareupdate -ia   (sometimes has things not listed in the App Store Updates, like some system updates)
 - App Store (Updates)                     (GUI for most MacOS/iOS updates)
                                           (sometimes has things not listed in "softwareupdate -l", like iMovie stuff)
 - Homebrew                                (package manager for Mac shell tools)
   brew update; brew upgrade -v; brew cleanup; brew doctor
                                           (additional:   can install and use Homebrew Cask for GUI apps)
                                           (alternatives: could install and use macports, fink, or pkgin)
 - Conda                                   (package manager, happens to be associated with Anaconda data science package distribution)
   conda update --prefix /Users/zero/Tools/anaconda3 anaconda
   conda clean --all
                                           (for more info: conda --help)
 - Pip?
   (pup  pip update)
   (pip is part of conda -- no need for a 'pup')
   (?) pip install --upgrade pip
   (?) pip3 install --upgrade pip3

 - VirtualBox
     (open the VirualBox GUI, see if it has an update notification; if so, download and install the update)
     (after updating, open the GUI again and it may/should inform that the Extension Pack is out-of-date and give option to download and install updated version; delete old version)
